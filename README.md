# 🚢 Titanic Data Analysis and Visualization

Welcome to the Titanic Data Analysis project! This repository contains an in-depth exploration of the Titanic dataset using **R** for data wrangling and analysis, and **Tableau** for interactive dashboard visualizations.

---

## 📁 Project Overview

In this project, we aimed to analyze the Titanic dataset to understand the factors that influenced passenger survival. We explored relationships between survival and features such as:

- 🎯 Passenger class (Pclass)
- 🧍‍♀️ Gender
- 🎂 Age
- ⚖️ Fare
- 👨‍👩‍👧 Family size
- 📍 Embarkation point

---

## 📊 Tools & Technologies

- `R` 📘 – Data cleaning, EDA, visualization
- `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `tidyr` – Core R packages used
- `Tableau` 📈 – Dashboard to visualize survival patterns interactively
- `R Markdown` – Reproducible reporting and documentation

---

## 📌 Key Findings

- Females and children had significantly higher survival rates than adult males.
- Passengers in **first class** were more likely to survive than those in second or third class.
- Those who embarked from **Cherbourg** had a slightly higher survival rate.
- Larger family sizes showed a non-linear relationship with survival probability.
- Age and fare also played important roles but had complex distributions.
